<H1>Making my 3+1 RSI ( one is just optional )</H1>
Used 4 RSIs which give a very much every trend related detail... best for uptrend and Downtrend market. 
just go to your trading view Terminal and copy Paste this in "PINE EDITOR" and then ADD TO CHART.

now you can easily take Swing trades 
just a basic way to do so 

best you can do is:
1.) Use it on daily Timeframe
2.) Use wait for all rsi going above level simultaneously wait for a break out
3.) just take up a trade
